## How it works
This project is the Snake game, except the maximum snake size is capped at 20 to fit the 1x2 tile limit, and the snake is rainbow for fun. The game is displayed via a VGA interface (640x480 resolution) and the gameboard is 8x8 tiles centered centered in the middle of the screen. Each game tile is 32x32 pixels so the gameboard is 256x256 pixels.

The snake is implemented as a 20-tile shift register storing each tile of the current snake's row/col (6 bits). This shift register takes up the majority of the tile space hence the cap at length=20. But, you can still keep playing the game after the maximum snake size is reached; the snake just won't grow anymore. You'll see the displayed scores turn purple when the max size is reached and it will keep incrementing till score=99 since I only put enough space for 2 BCD digits. If you're a total beast at snake game and reach 99 points, the score will just hold at 99 until you eventually die. User game controls are 4 buttons (or a joystick) for snake direction controls, and another button for starting the snake's movement upon reset or reincarnation.


## How to test

1. Hook up a 25MHz clock to the chip (since the VGA is running at 640x480 resolution - technically should be 25.175MHz pixel clock but 25MHz has been working just fine for me).
2. Hook up rst_n to a button or something else that you can easily pulse.
3. Hook up buttons or joystick to the ui_in[4:1] input pins (these correspond to the direction that the snake moves).
4. Also hook up a button to ui_in[7] for the start_game control input.
5. Connect R0, R1, G0, G1, B0, B1 (6-bit RGB) and VGA_HS, VGA_VS pins to TinyVGA PMOD board, and connect that PMOD to a VGA monitor. {R0, R1, G0, G1, B0, B1} connect to uo[7:2] and {VGA_HS, VGA_VS} connect to uo[1:0].
6. You can also connect the output LEDs if you want, but this is optional as the LED outputs are just showing the current button presses. These will be on the bidirectional I/O pins, uio[7:0].
7. Hopefully you should be able to play now!


## External hardware
1. 6x buttons, or 2x buttons if using joystick for move controls
2. Joystick if desired
3. VGA monitor + VGA cable
4. TinyVGA PMOD connector (I only have 6-bit RGB)
5. 4x LEDs if desired
